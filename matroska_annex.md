# Historic Deprecated Elements

As Matroska has evolved since 2002, many parts that were considered for use in the format were never
used and often incorrectly designed. Many of the elements that were defined then are not
found in any known files but were part of public specs. DivX also had a few custom elements that
were designed for custom features.

In this appendix, we list elements that have a known ID that **SHOULD NOT** be reused to avoid colliding
with existing files. These might be reassigned by IANA in the future if there are no more IDs for a given size.
A short description of what each ID was used for is included, but the text is not normative.

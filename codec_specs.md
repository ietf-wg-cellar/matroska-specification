# Codec Mappings

A `Codec Mapping` is a set of attributes to identify, name, and contextualize the format
and characteristics of encoded data that can be contained within Matroska Clusters.

Each TrackEntry used within Matroska **MUST** reference a defined `Codec Mapping` using the
`Codec ID` to identify and describe the format of the encoded data in its associated Clusters.
This `Codec ID` is a unique registered identifier that represents the encoding stored within
the Track. Certain encodings **MAY** also require some form of codec initialization
in order to provide its decoder with context and technical metadata.

The intention behind this list is not to list all existing audio and video codecs,
but rather to list those codecs that are currently supported in Matroska and therefore
need a well defined `Codec ID` so that all developers supporting Matroska will use the
same `Codec ID`. If you feel we missed support for a very important codec, please tell
us on our development mailing list (cellar at ietf.org).

## Defining Matroska Codec Support

Support for a codec is defined in Matroska with the following values.

### Codec ID

Each codec supported for storage in Matroska **MUST** have a unique `Codec ID`.
Each `Codec ID` **MUST** be prefixed with the string from the following table according to
the associated type of the codec. All characters of a `Codec ID Prefix` **MUST** be
capital letters (A-Z) except for the last character of a `Codec ID Prefix` which **MUST** be
an underscore ("_").

Codec Type | Codec ID Prefix
-----------|----------------
Video      | "V_"
Audio      | "A_"
Subtitle   | "S_"
Button     | "B_"

Each `Codec ID` **MUST** include a `Major Codec ID` immediately following the `Codec ID Prefix`.
A `Major Codec ID` **MAY** be followed by an **OPTIONAL** `Codec ID Suffix` to communicate a refinement
of the `Major Codec ID`. If a `Codec ID Suffix` is used, then the `Codec ID` **MUST** include a
forward slash ("/") as a separator between the `Major Codec ID` and the `Codec ID Suffix`.
The `Major Codec ID` **MUST** be composed of only capital letters (A-Z) and numbers (0-9).
The `Codec ID Suffix` **MUST** be composed of only capital letters (A-Z), numbers (0-9),
underscore ("_"), and forward slash ("/").

The following table provides examples of valid `Codec IDs` and their components:

Codec ID Prefix | Major Codec ID | Separator | Codec ID Suffix | Codec ID
----------------|:---------------|:----------|:----------------|:--------
A_              | AAC            | /         | MPEG2/LC/SBR    | A_AAC/MPEG2/LC/SBR
V_              | MPEG4          | /         | ISO/ASP         | V_MPEG4/ISO/ASP
V_              | MPEG1          |           |                 | V_MPEG1

### Codec Name

Each encoding supported for storage in Matroska **MUST** have a `Codec Name`.
The `Codec Name` provides a readable label for the encoding.

### Description

An optional description for the encoding. This value is only intended for human consumption.

### Initialization

Each encoding supported for storage in Matroska **MUST** have a defined Initialization.
The Initialization **MUST** describe the storage of data necessary to initialize the decoder,
which **MUST** be stored within the `CodecPrivate Element`. When the Initialization is updated
within a track, then that updated Initialization data **MUST** be written into the `CodecState Element`
of the first `Cluster` to require it. If the encoding does not require any form of Initialization,
then `none` **MUST** be used to define the Initialization and the `CodecPrivate Element`
**SHOULD NOT** be written and **MUST** be ignored. Data that is defined Initialization to be
stored in the `CodecPrivate Element` is known as `Private Data`.

### Codec BlockAdditions

Additional data that contextualizes or supplements a `Block` can be stored within
the `BlockAdditional Element` of a `BlockMore Element`. This `BlockAdditional` data **MAY**
be passed to the associated decoder along with the content of the `Block Element`.
Each `BlockAdditional` is coupled with a `BlockAddID` that identifies the kind of data
it contains. The following table defines the meanings of `BlockAddID` values.

BlockAddID Value | Definition
-----------------|:---------------
0                | Invalid.
1                | Indicates that the context of the `BlockAdditional` data is defined by the corresponding `Codec Mapping`.
2 or greater     | `BlockAddID` values of 2 and greater are mapped to the `BlockAddIDValue` of the `BlockAdditionMapping` of the associated Track.

The values of `BlockAddID` that are 2 of greater have no semantic meaning, but simply
associate the `BlockMore Element` with a `BlockAdditionMapping` of the associated Track.
See (#block-additional-mapping) on Block Additional Mappings for more information.

The following XML depicts the nested Elements of a `BlockGroup Element` with an example of BlockAdditions:

```xml
<BlockGroup>
  <Block>{Binary data of a VP9 video frame in YUV}</Block>
  <BlockAdditions>
    <BlockMore>
      <BlockAddID>1</BlockAddID>
      <BlockAdditional>
        {alpha channel encoding to supplement the VP9 frame}
      </BlockAdditional>
    </BlockMore>
  </BlockAdditions>
</BlockGroup>
```

### Citation

Documentation of the associated normative and informative references for the codec is **RECOMMENDED**.

### Deprecation Date

A timestamp, expressed in [@!RFC3339] that notes when support for the `Codec Mapping`
within Matroska was deprecated. If a `Codec Mapping` is defined with a `Deprecation Date`,
then it is **RECOMMENDED** that Matroska writers **SHOULD NOT** use the `Codec Mapping` after the `Deprecation Date`.

### Superseded By

A `Codec Mapping` **MAY** only be defined with a `Superseded By` value, if it has an
expressed `Deprecation Date`. If used, the `Superseded By` value **MUST** store
the `Codec ID` of another `Codec Mapping` that has superseded the `Codec Mapping`.

## Recommendations for the Creation of New Codec Mappings

Creators of new `Codec Mappings` to be used in the context of Matroska:

- **SHOULD** assume that all `Codec Mappings` they create might become standardized, public,
  commonly deployed, or usable across multiple implementations.

- **SHOULD** employ meaningful values for `Codec ID` and `Codec Name` that they have reason
  to believe are currently unused.

- **SHOULD NOT** prefix their `Codec ID` with "X_" or similar constructs.

These recommendations are based upon Section 3 of [@!RFC6648].

## Matroska Codec IDs Registry

This document defines registries for Codec IDs stored in the `CodecID` element.
A `CodecID` is a case-sensitive ASCII string with a `V_`, `A_`, `S_` and `B_` prefix for
video, audio, subtitle and button tracks respectively. The details of the string format
are found in (#codec-id).

# AOM AV1 codec mapping in Matroska/WebM

This document specifies the storage format for [AV1](#av1-specifications) bitstreams in [Matroska](#matroska-specifications) video tracks. Every time [Matroska](#referenced-documents) is mentioned it applies equally to [WebM](#webm-container).

Elements in this document inside square brackets __[]__ refer to elements as defined in the [AV1 Specifications](#av1-specifications).


# Terms

## Block
A Matroska element to store a Frame. Can also be a `SimpleBlock` when not inside a `BlockGroup`. Using `Block` in this document will mean both forms of Block.

## CodecID
The name used to describe a codec in Matroska.

## CVS
A Coded Video Sequence is a sequence of `Temporal Units` where the contents of __[sequence_header_obu]__ must be bit-identical for all the `Sequence Header OBUs` found in the sequence before Matroska encapsulation except for the contents of __[operating_parameters_info]__. A `Sequence Header OBU` made of all the identical bits in the CVS is referred to a the `CVS Sequence Header OBU`.

## CodecPrivate
Extra data store in Matroska and passed to the decoder before decoding starts. It can also be used to store the profiles and other data to better identify the codec.

## OBU
Open Bitstream Unit is the basic unit of data in AV1. It contains a header and a payload.

## Segment
The top Matroska element that contains interleaved audio, video, subtitles as well as track descriptions, chapters, tags, etc. Usually a Matroska file is made of one Segment.

## Temporal Unit
All the OBUs that are associated with a time instant. It consists of a `Temporal Delimiter OBU`, and all the OBUs that follow, up to but not including the next `Temporal Delimiter OBU`. It **MAY** contain multiple frames but only one is presented.


# Mandatory TrackEntry elements

## CodecID
EBML Path: `\Segment\Tracks\TrackEntry\CodecID` | Mandatory: Yes

The `CodecID` **MUST** be the ASCII string `V_AV1`.

## CodecPrivate
EBML Path: `\Segment\Tracks\TrackEntry\CodecPrivate` | Mandatory: Yes

The `CodecPrivate` consists of 4 octets similar to the first 4 octets of the [ISOBMFF](#isobmff-av1-mapping) `AV1CodecConfigurationRecord`. Most of the values in this bitfield come from the `CVS Sequence Header OBU`. The bits are spread as follows, with the most significant bit first:

```c
unsigned int (1) marker always 1
unsigned int (7) version currently 1

unsigned int (3) seq_profile
unsigned int (5) seq_level_idx_0

unsigned int (1) seq_tier_0
unsigned int (1) high_bitdepth
unsigned int (1) twelve_bit
unsigned int (1) monochrome
unsigned int (1) chroma_subsampling_x
unsigned int (1) chroma_subsampling_y
unsigned int (2) chroma_sample_position

unsigned int (3) reserved currently 0
unsigned int (1) initial_presentation_delay_present
unsigned int (4) initial_presentation_delay_minus_one
```

* `seq_profile` corresponds to the __[seq_profile]__ in the `CVS Sequence Header OBU`.
* `seq_level_idx_0` corresponds to the __[seq_level_idx[0]]__ in the `CVS Sequence Header OBU`.
* `seq_tier_0` corresponds to the __[seq_tier[0]]__ in the `CVS Sequence Header OBU`.
* `twelve_bit` corresponds to the __[twelve_bit]__ in the `CVS Sequence Header OBU`, or 0 if not present.
* `monochrome` corresponds to the __[mono_chrome]__ in the `CVS Sequence Header OBU`.
* `chroma_subsampling_x` corresponds to the __[subsampling_x]__ in the `CVS Sequence Header OBU`.
* `chroma_subsampling_y` corresponds to the __[subsampling_y]__ in the `CVS Sequence Header OBU`.
* `chroma_sample_position` corresponds to the __[chroma_sample_position]__ in the `CVS Sequence Header OBU`, or 0 (CSP_UNKNOWN) if not defined.

The `initial_presentation_delay_minus_one` field indicates the number of frames (minus one) that need to be decoded prior to starting the presentation of the first frame so that that each frame will be decoded prior to its presentation time under the constraints indicated by `seq_level_idx_0` in the `CodecPrivate`. More precisely, the following procedure **MUST NOT** return any error:
- construct a hypothetical bitstream consisting of the OBUs carried in the frame followed by the OBUs carried in all the frames referring to that frame,
- for each `Sequence Header OBU` set __[initial_display_delay_minus_1[0]]__ to the number of frames, minus one, contained in the first (`initial_presentation_delay_minus_one` + 1) `Blocks`, including the non presentable frames,
- set the __[frame_presentation_time]__ field of the __[frame_header_obu]__ of each presentable frame such that it matches the presentation time difference between the frame carrying this frame and the previous frame (if it exists, 0 otherwise),
- apply the decoder model specified in [AV1](#av1-specifications) to this hypothetical bitstream using the first operating point. If __[buffer_removal_time]__ information is present in bitstream for this operating point, the decoding schedule mode **MUST** be applied, otherwise the resource availability mode **MUST** be applied.

If a muxer cannot verify the above procedure, `initial_presentation_delay_present` **SHOULD** be set to 0.

__[initial_display_delay_minus_1[0]]__ and `initial_presentation_delay_minus_one` are very similar. The former deals with all frames in the bitstream, even non-visible ones, whereas the latter only deals with visible frames found in the `Blocks`. The non-visible frames are also in the `Blocks` but not known by the container level.

If `initial_presentation_delay_present` is 0, then all bits of `initial_presentation_delay_minus_one` **SHOULD** be 0 and **MUST** be discarded.

This structure **MAY** be followed by OBUs that are valid for the whole CVS. Only OBUs of type `OBU_SEQUENCE_HEADER` and `OBU_METADATA` are allowed in the `CodecPrivate`. If present, the OBU of type `OBU_SEQUENCE_HEADER`, the `CVS Sequence Header OBU`, **MUST** be the only one of type `OBU_SEQUENCE_HEADER` and the first OBU after the structure.

OBUs in the `CodecPrivate` **MUST** have the __[obu_has_size_field]__ set to 1, indicating that the size of the OBU payload follows the header, and that it is coded using __[LEB128]__, except for the last OBU in the `CodecPrivate`, for which __[obu_has_size_field]__ **MAY** be set to 0, in which case it is assumed to fill the remainder of the `CodecPrivate`.

The __[timing_info_present_flag]__ of the `Sequence Header OBU` **SHOULD** be 0. Even when it is 1 the presentation time of the `Frame Header OBUs` in `Blocks` should be discarded. In other words, only the timestamps given by the Matroska container **MUST** be used.

## PixelWidth
EBML Path: `\Segment\Tracks\TrackEntry\Video\PixelWidth` | Mandatory: Yes

The `PixelWidth` **MUST** be __[max_frame_width_minus_1]__+1.

## PixelHeight
EBML Path: `\Segment\Tracks\TrackEntry\Video\PixelHeight` | Mandatory: Yes

The `PixelHeight` **MUST** be __[max_frame_height_minus_1]__+1.


# Block Data
Each `Block` contains one `Temporal Unit` containing one or more OBUs. Each OBU stored in the Block **MUST** contain its header and its payload.

The OBUs in the `Block` follow the __[Low Overhead Bitstream Format syntax]__. They **MUST** have the __[obu_has_size_field]__ set to 1 except for the last OBU in the frame, for which __[obu_has_size_field]__ **MAY** be set to 0, in which case it is assumed to fill the remainder of the frame.

The order of OBUs should follow the order defined in the section 7.5 of the [AV1 Specifications](#av1-specifications).

There **MUST** be at least one `Frame Header OBU` per `Block`.

OBU trailing bits **SHOULD** be limited to octet alignment and **SHOULD NOT** be used for padding.

OBUs of type `OBU_TEMPORAL_DELIMITER`, `OBU_REDUNDANT_FRAME_HEADER` and `OBU_PADDING` **SHOULD NOT** be used.

OBUs of type `OBU_TILE_LIST` **MUST NOT** be used.

A `SimpleBlock` **MUST NOT** be marked as a Keyframe if it doesn't contain a `Frame OBU`. A `SimpleBlock` **MUST NOT** be marked as a Keyframe if the first `Frame OBU` doesn't have a __[frame_type]__ of `KEY_FRAME`. A `SimpleBlock` **MUST NOT** be marked as a Keyframe if it doesn't contains a `Sequence Header OBU`.

A `Block` inside a `BlockGroup` **MUST** use `ReferenceBlock` elements if the first `Frame OBU` in the `Block` has a __[frame_type]__ other than `KEY_FRAME`. A `Block` inside a `BlockGroup` **MUST** use `ReferenceBlock` elements if the `Block` doesn't contain a `Sequence Header OBU`.

A `Block` with __[frame_header_obu]__ where the __[frame_type]__  is `INTRA_ONLY_FRAME` **MUST** use a `ReferenceBlock` with a value of 0 to reference itself. This way it cannot be mistaken for a Random Access Point.

`ReferenceBlocks` inside a `BlockGroup` **MUST** reference frames in other previous `Blocks` according to the __[ref_frame_idx]__ values of the frame which is neither a `KEYFRAME` nor an `INTRA_ONLY_FRAME`.

*Note: `SimpleBlock` and `BlockGroup` can be used for each type of frame. `SimpleBlock` is usually preferred if features of the `BlockGroup` (`BlockDuration`, `BlockAdditions`, etc) are not needed.*

The __[temporal_point_info]__ contained in  `Frame OBUs` or `Frame Header OBUs` **SHOULD** be discarded.

The `Block` timestamp is translated from the __[PresentationTime]__ without the __[InitialPresentationDelay]__.

When reconstructing the AV1 bitstream from a `Block` a `Temporal Delimiter OBU` should be prepended to the `Block` data.


# Segment Restrictions

Matroska restricts the allowed changes within a codec for the whole `Segment`. Each output frames of a `Segment` **MUST** have the same pixel dimensions (`PixelWidth` and `PixelHeight`).

An AV1 `Track` has the same requirements as the `CVS`: the contents of __[sequence_header_obu]__ must be bit-identical for all the `Sequence Header OBUs` found in the `Blocks` except for the contents of __[operating_parameters_info]__ which can vary.


# Cue Considerations

Matroska uses `CuePoints` for seeking. Each `Block` can be referenced in the `Cues` but in practice it's better to only seek to proper Random Access Points of the codec. It means only `SimpleBlock` marked as Keyframe and `BlockGroup` with no `ReferenceBlock` **SHOULD** be referenced in the `Cues`.


# Encryption

The Encryption scheme is similar to the one used for WebM, using the `ContentEncryption` elements and extra `ContentEncAESSettings` and `AESSettingsCipherMode` elements. Only the Subsample Encrypted Block Format mode **SHOULD** be used when encryption is needed. It is similar to the Common Encryption subsample pattern encryption scheme `cens`, using partial encryption of subsamples with AES-CTR cipher mode. More details on the WebM encryption system can be found at https://www.webmproject.org/docs/webm-encryption/.

Protected `Blocks` **MUST** be exactly spanned by one or more contiguous partitions.

* An OBU **MAY** be spanned by one or more partitions, especially when it has multiple ranges of protected data. However writers **SHOULD** reduce the number of partitions as possible. This can be achieved by using a partition that spans multiple consecutive unprotected OBUs as well as the first unprotected part of the following protected OBU, if such protected OBU exists.

* A large subsample that is larger than the maximum size of a single partition (stored on 32 bits integer) **MAY** be spanned over multiple partitions separated by a zero-size partition, since the partitions alternate protected/unprotected partitions.


Within a protected `Block`, the following constraints apply to all the OBUs it contains:

* All __[obu_header]__ structures and associated __[obu_size]__ fields **MUST NOT** be encrypted.

* OBUs of type `OBU_TEMPORAL_DELIMITER`, `OBU_SEQUENCE_HEADER`, `OBU_FRAME_HEADER` (including within an `OBU_FRAME`), `OBU_REDUNDANT_FRAME_HEADER` and `OBU_PADDING` **MUST NOT** be encrypted.

* OBUs of type `OBU_METADATA` **MAY** be encrypted.

* OBUs of type `OBU_FRAME` and `OBU_TILE_GROUP` are partially encrypted. Within such OBUs, the following applies:

    * Encrypted partitions **MUST** be a multiple of 16 bytes.

    * An encrypted partition **MUST** be created for each tile whose __[decode_tile]__ structure size (including any trailing bits) is larger or equal to 16 bytes. Smaller __[decode_tile]__ structures **MUST NOT** be encrypted.

    * Encrypted partitions **MUST** end on the last byte of the __[decode_tile]__ structure (including any trailing bits).

    * Encrypted partitions **MUST** span all complete 16-byte blocks of the __[decode_tile]__ structure (including any trailing bits).

    * Bytes at the beginning of the __[decode_tile]__ that do not fit in the 16-byte encrypted partitions **SHOULD** be added to the preceding unprotected partition. As a result the Encrypted partitions might not start at the first byte of the __[decode_tile]__ structure, but some number of bytes following that.

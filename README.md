## About this site

This site runs on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) powered by [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/blob/master/README.markdown). Approved changes made to the gh-pages branch of this repository can be viewed instantly on the [associated webpage](http://ablwr.github.io/mkv_jekyll_poc/).

If this repository is cloned onto a local machine, it can be run locally. Jekyll runs on Ruby. Like many Ruby projects, it will require that Ruby is installed on the machine. Bundler, a popular Ruby package manager gem, can be used to install the other gem-based dependencies. After these are loaded properly, a local preview of any changes can be viewed by running `jekyll serve` on the command line. Jekyll provides more in-depth options for local usage [in their docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/usage/).

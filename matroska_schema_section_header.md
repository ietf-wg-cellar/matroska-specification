# Matroska Schema

This specification includes an `EBML Schema`, which defines the Elements and structure
of Matroska using the EBML Schema elements and attributes defined in Section 11.1 of [@!RFC8794].
The EBML Schema defines every valid Matroska element in a manner defined by the EBML specification.

Attributes using their default value like `minOccurs`, `minver`, etc. or with undefined values like `length`, `maxver`, etc. are omitted. 

Here the definition of each Matroska Element is provided.

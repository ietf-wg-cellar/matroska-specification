This documents adds the following codec mappings, with the same definition format as in [@!I-D.ietf-cellar-codec].

## A_MPC

Codec ID: A_MPC

Description: The main developer for musepack has requested that we wait until the SV8 framing has been fully defined
for musepack before defining how to store it in Matroska. See [@!Musepack].

# Matroska versioning

Matroska is based upon the principle that a reading application does not have to support
100% of the specifications in order to be able to play the file. A Matroska file therefore
contains version indicators that tell a reading application what to expect.

It is possible and valid to have the version fields indicate that the file contains
Matroska `Elements` from a higher specification version number while signaling that a
reading application **MUST** only support a lower version number properly in order to play
it back (possibly with a reduced feature set).

The `EBML Header` of each Matroska document informs the reading application on what
version of Matroska to expect. The `Elements` within `EBML Header` with jurisdiction
over this information are `DocTypeVersion` and `DocTypeReadVersion`.

`DocTypeVersion` **MUST** be equal to or greater than the highest Matroska version number of
any `Element` present in the Matroska file. For example, a file using the `SimpleBlock Element` ((#simpleblock-element))
**MUST** have a `DocTypeVersion` equal to or greater than 2. A file containing `CueRelativePosition`
Elements  ((#cuerelativeposition-element)) **MUST** have a `DocTypeVersion` equal to or greater than 4.

The `DocTypeReadVersion` **MUST** contain the minimum version number that a reading application
can minimally support in order to play the file back -- optionally with a reduced feature
set. For example, if a file contains only `Elements` of version 2 or lower except for
`CueRelativePosition` (which is a version 4 Matroska `Element`), then `DocTypeReadVersion`
**SHOULD** still be set to 2 and not 4 because evaluating `CueRelativePosition` is not
necessary for standard playback -- it makes seeking more precise if used.

A reading application supporting Matroska version `V` **MUST NOT** refuse to read a
file with `DocReadTypeVersion` equal to or lower than `V` even if `DocTypeVersion`
is greater than `V`.

A reading application
supporting at least Matroska version `V` reading a file whose `DocTypeReadVersion`
field is equal to or lower than `V` **MUST** skip Matroska/EBML `Elements` it encounters
but does not know about if that unknown element fits into the size constraints set
by the current `Parent Element`.

# Stream Copy

It is sometimes necessary to create a Matroska file from another Matroska file, for example to add subtitles in a language
or to edit out a portion of the content.
Some values from the original Matroska file need to be kept the same in the destination file.
For example, the SamplingFrequency of an audio track wouldn't change between the two files.
Some other values may change between the two files, for example the TrackNumber of an audio track when another track has been added.

An Element is marked with a property: `stream copy: True` when the values of that Element need to be kept identical between the source and destination file.
If that property is not set, elements may or may not keep the same value between the source and destination.

# DefaultDecodedFieldDuration

The `DefaultDecodedFieldDuration Element` can signal to the displaying application how
often fields of a video sequence will be available for displaying. It can be used for both
interlaced and progressive content. 

If the video sequence is signaled as interlaced (#flaginterlaced-element), then `DefaultDecodedFieldDuration` equals 
the period between two successive fields at the output of the decoding process.
For video sequences signaled as progressive, `DefaultDecodedFieldDuration` is half of 
the period between two successive frames at the output of the decoding process.

These values are valid at the end of the decoding process before post-processing
(such as deinterlacing or inverse telecine) is applied.

Examples:

* Blu-ray movie:      1000000000 ns/(48/1.001) = 20854167 ns
* PAL broadcast/DVD:  1000000000 ns/(50/1.000) = 20000000 ns
* N/ATSC broadcast:   1000000000 ns/(60/1.001) = 16683333 ns
* hard-telecined DVD: 1000000000 ns/(60/1.001) = 16683333 ns (60 encoded interlaced fields per second)
* soft-telecined DVD: 1000000000 ns/(60/1.001) = 16683333 ns (48 encoded interlaced fields per second, with "repeat_first_field = 1")

# Cluster Blocks

Frames using references **SHOULD** be stored in "coding order". That means the references first, and then
the frames referencing them. A consequence is that timestamps might not be consecutive.
But a frame with a past timestamp **MUST** reference a frame already known, otherwise it's considered bad/void.

Matroska has two similar ways to store frames in a block:

* in a `Block` which is contained inside a `BlockGroup`,
* or in a `SimpleBlock` which is directly in the `Cluster`.

The `SimpleBlock` is usually preferred unless some extra elements of the `BlockGroup` need to be used.
A Matroska Reader **MUST** support both types of blocks.

Each block contains the same parts in the following order:

* a variable length header,
* optionally the lacing information,
* the consecutive frame(s)

The block header starts with the number of the Track it corresponds to. 
The value **MUST** corresponding to the `TrackNumber` ((#tracknumber-element)) of a `TrackEntry` of the `Segment`.

The `TrackNumber` is coded using the VINT mechanism described in Section 4 of [@!RFC8794].
To save space, the shortest VINT form **SHOULD** be used. The value can be coded on up to 8 octets. 
This is the only element with a variable size in the block header.

The timestamp is expressed in Track Ticks; see (#timestamp-ticks). 
The value is stored as a signed value on 16 bits.

## Block Structure

This section describes the binary data contained in the `Block` Element (#block-element). Bit 0 is the most significant bit.

As the `TrackNumber` size can vary between 1 and 8 octets, there are 8 different sizes for the `Block` header.
We only provide the definitions for `TrackNumber` sizes of 1 and 2. 
The other variants can be deduced by extending the size of the `TrackNumber` by multiples of 8 bits.

The following data in the `SimpleBlock` correspond to the lacing data and frames usage as described in each respective lacing mode.

## Block Lacing

Lacing is a mechanism to save space when storing data. It is typically used for small blocks
of data (referred to as frames in Matroska). It packs multiple frames into a single `Block` or `SimpleBlock`.

Lacing **MUST NOT** be used to store a single frame in a `Block` or `SimpleBlock`.

There are 3 types of lacing:

1. Xiph, inspired by what is found in the Ogg container [@?RFC3533]
2. EBML, which is the same with sizes coded differently
3. fixed-size, where the size is not coded

When lacing is not used, i.e. to store a single frame, the lacing bits 5 and 6 of the `Block` or `SimpleBlock` **MUST** be set to zero.

For example, a user wants to store 3 frames of the same track. The first frame is 800 octets long,
the second is 500 octets long and the third is 1000 octets long. As these data are small,
they can be stored in a lace to save space.

It is possible not to use lacing at all and just store a single frame without any extra data.
When the FlagLacing -- (#flaglacing-element) -- is set to "0" all blocks of that track **MUST NOT** use lacing.

### No lacing

When no lacing is used, the number of frames in the lace is ommitted and only one frame can be stored in the Block.
The bits 5-6 of the Block Header flags are set to `00`.

The Block for an 800 octets frame is as follows:

| Block Octets | Value   | Description             |
|:-------------|:--------|:------------------------|
| 4-803        | <frame> | Single frame data       |
Table: No lacing{#blockNoLacing}

When a Block contains a single frame, it **MUST** use this No lacing mode.


### Xiph lacing

The Xiph lacing uses the same coding of size as found in the Ogg container [@?RFC3533].
The bits 5-6 of the Block Header flags are set to `01`.

The Block data with laced frames is stored as follows:

* Lacing Head on 1 Octet: Number of frames in the lace minus 1.
* Lacing size of each frame except the last one.
* Binary data of each frame consecutively.

The lacing size is split into 255 values, stored as unsigned octets -- for example, 500 is coded 255;245 or [0xFF 0xF5].
A frame with a size multiple of 255 is coded with a 0 at the end of the size -- for example, 765 is coded 255;255;255;0 or [0xFF 0xFF 0xFF 0x00].

The size of the last frame is deduced from the size remaining in the Block after the other frames.

Because large sizes result in large coding of the sizes, it is **RECOMMENDED** to use Xiph lacing only with small frames.

In our example, the 800, 500 and 1000 frames are stored with Xiph lacing in a Block as follows:

| Block Octet | Value | Description             |
|:------------|:------|:------------------------|
| 4           | 0x02  | Number of frames minus 1|
| 5-8         | 0xFF 0xFF 0xFF 0x23  | Size of the first frame (255;255;255;35)|
| 9-10        | 0xFF 0xF5  | Size of the second frame (255;245)|
| 11-810      |       | First frame data  |
| 811-1310    |       | Second frame data |
| 1311-2310   |       | Third frame data  |
Table: Xiph lacing example{#blockXiphLacing}

The Block is 2311 octets large and the last frame starts at 1311, so we can deduce the size of the last frame is 2311 - 1311 = 1000.


### EBML lacing

The EBML lacing encodes the frame size with an EBML-like encoding [@!RFC8794].
The bits 5-6 of the Block Header flags are set to `11`.

The Block data with laced frames is stored as follows:

* Lacing Head on 1 Octet: Number of frames in the lace minus 1.
* Lacing size of each frame except the last one.
* Binary data of each frame consecutively.

The first frame size is encoded as an EBML Variable-Size Integer value, also known as VINT in [@!RFC8794].
The remaining frame sizes are encoded as signed values using the difference between the frame size and the previous frame size.
These signed values are encoded as VINT, with a mapping from signed to unsigned numbers.
Decoding the unsigned number stored in the VINT to a signed number is done by subtracting 2^((7*n)-1)^-1, where `n` is the octet size of the VINT.


Bit Representation of signed VINT                       | Possible Value Range
:-------------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------
1xxx xxxx                                               | 2^7 values from -(2^6^-1) to 2^6^
01xx xxxx  xxxx xxxx                                    | 2^14 values from -(2^13^-1) to 2^13^
001x xxxx  xxxx xxxx  xxxx xxxx                         | 2^21 values from -(2^20^-1) to 2^20^
0001 xxxx  xxxx xxxx  xxxx xxxx  xxxx xxxx              | 2^28 values from -(2^27^-1) to 2^27^
0000 1xxx  xxxx xxxx  xxxx xxxx  xxxx xxxx  xxxx xxxx   | 2^35 values from -(2^34^-1) to 2^34^
Table: EBML Lacing signed VINT bits usage{#ebmlLacingBits}

In our example, the 800, 500 and 1000 frames are stored with EBML lacing in a Block as follows:

| Block Octets | Value | Description             |
|:-------------|:------|:------------------------|
| 4            | 0x02  | Number of frames minus 1|
| 5-6          | 0x43 0x20 | Size of the first frame (800 = 0x320 + 0x4000)|
| 7-8          | 0x5E 0xD3 | Size of the second frame (500 - 800 = -300 = - 0x12C + 0x1FFF + 0x4000)|
| 8-807        | <frame1>  | First frame data  |
| 808-1307     | <frame2>  | Second frame data |
| 1308-2307    | <frame3>  | Third frame data  |
Table: EBML lacing example{#blockEbmlLacing}

The Block is 2308 octets large and the last frame starts at 1308, so we can deduce the size of the last frame is 2308 - 1308 = 1000.


### Fixed-size lacing

The Fixed-size lacing doesn't store the frame size, only the number of frames in the lace.
Each frame **MUST** have the same size. The frame size of each frame is deduced from the total size of the Block.
The bits 5-6 of the Block Header flags are set to `10`.

The Block data with laced frames is stored as follows:

* Lacing Head on 1 Octet: Number of frames in the lace minus 1.
* Binary data of each frame consecutively.

For example, for 3 frames of 800 octets each:

| Block Octets | Value    | Description             |
|:-------------|:---------|:------------------------|
| 4            | 0x02     | Number of frames minus 1|
| 5-804        | <frame1> | First frame data  |
| 805-1604     | <frame2> | Second frame data |
| 1605-2404    | <frame3> | Third frame data  |
Table: Fixed-size lacing example{#blockFixedSizeLacing}

This gives a Block of 2405 octets. When reading the Block we find that there are 3 frames (Octet 4).
The data start at Octet 5, so the size of each frame is (2405 - 5) / 3 = 800.


### Laced Frames Timestamp

A Block only contains a single timestamp value. But when lacing is used, it contains more than one frame.
Each frame originally has its own timestamp, or Presentation Timestamp (PTS). That timestamp applies to
the first frame in the lace.

In the lace, each frame after the first one has an underdetermined timestamp.
But each of these frames **MUST** be contiguous -- i.e. the decoded data **MUST NOT** contain any gap
between them. If there is a gap in the stream, the frames around the gap **MUST NOT** be in the same Block.

Lacing is only useful for small contiguous data to save space. This is usually the case for audio tracks
and not the case for video -- which use a lot of data -- or subtitle tracks -- which have long gaps.
For audio, there is usually a fixed output sampling frequency for the whole track.
So the decoder should be able to recover the timestamp of each sample, knowing each
output sample is contiguous with a fixed frequency.
For subtitles this is usually not the case so lacing **SHOULD NOT** be used.



## Random Access Points

Random Access Points (RAP) are positions where the parser can seek to and start playback without decoding
of what was before. In Matroska `BlockGroups` and `SimpleBlocks` can be RAPs.
To seek to these elements it is still necessary to seek to the `Cluster` containing them,
read the Cluster Timestamp
and start playback from the `BlockGroup` or `SimpleBlock` that is a RAP.

Because a Matroska File is usually composed of multiple tracks playing at the same time
-- video, audio and subtitles -- to seek properly to a RAP, each selected track must be
taken in account. Usually all audio and subtitle `BlockGroup` or `SimpleBlock` are RAP.
They are independent of each other and can be played randomly.

Video tracks on the other hand often use references to previous and future frames for better
coding efficiency. Frames with such reference **MUST** either contain one or more
`ReferenceBlock` Elements in their `BlockGroup` or **MUST** be marked
as non-keyframe in a `SimpleBlock`; see (#simpleblock-structure).

* BlockGroup with a frame that references another frame, with the EBML tree shown as XML:

```xml
<Cluster>
  <Timestamp>123456</Timestamp>
  <BlockGroup>
    <!-- References a Block 40 Track Ticks before this one -->
    <ReferenceBlock>-40</ReferenceBlock>
    <Block/>
  </BlockGroup>
  ...
</Cluster>
```

* SimpleBlock with a frame that references another frame, with the EBML tree shown as XML:

```xml
<Cluster>
  <Timestamp>123456</Timestamp>
  <SimpleBlock/> (octet 3 bit 0 not set)
  ...
</Cluster>
```


Frames that are RAP -- i.e. they don't depend on other frames -- **MUST** set the keyframe
flag if they are in a `SimpleBlock` or their parent `BlockGroup` **MUST NOT** contain
a `ReferenceBlock`.

* BlockGroup with a frame that references no other frame, with the EBML tree shown as XML:

```xml
<Cluster>
  <Timestamp>123456</Timestamp>
  <BlockGroup>
    <!-- No ReferenceBlock allowed in this BlockGroup -->
    <Block/>
  </BlockGroup>
  ...
</Cluster>
```

* SimpleBlock with a frame that references no other frame, with the EBML tree shown as XML:

```xml
<Cluster>
  <Timestamp>123456</Timestamp>
  <SimpleBlock/> (octet 3 bit 0 set)
  ...
</Cluster>
```


There may be cases where the use of `BlockGroup` is necessary, as the frame may need a
`BlockDuration`, `BlockAdditions`, `CodecState` or a `DiscardPadding` element.
For thoses cases a `SimpleBlock` **MUST NOT** be used,
the reference information **SHOULD** be recovered for non-RAP frames.

* SimpleBlock with a frame that references another frame, with the EBML tree shown as XML:

```xml
<Cluster>
  <Timestamp>123456</Timestamp>
  <SimpleBlock/> (octet 3 bit 0 not set)
  ...
</Cluster>
```

* Same frame that references another frame put inside a BlockGroup to add `BlockDuration`, with the EBML tree shown as XML:

```xml
<Cluster>
  <Timestamp>123456</Timestamp>
  <BlockGroup>
    <!-- ReferenceBlock value recovered based on the codec -->
    <ReferenceBlock>-40</ReferenceBlock>
    <BlockDuration>20<BlockDuration>
    <Block/>
  </BlockGroup>
  ...
</Cluster>
```

When a frame in a `BlockGroup` is not a RAP, the `BlockGroup` **MUST** contain at least a `ReferenceBlock`.
The `ReferenceBlock`s **MUST** be used in one of the following ways:

* each reference frame listed as a `ReferenceBlock`,
* some referenced frame listed as a `ReferenceBlock`, even if the timestamp value is accurate,
* or one `ReferenceBlock` with the timestamp value "0" corresponding to a self or unknown reference.

The lack of `ReferenceBlock` would mean such a frame is a RAP and seeking on that
frame that actually depends on other frames may create bogus output or even crash.

* Same frame that references another frame put inside a BlockGroup but the reference could not be recovered, with the EBML tree shown as XML:

```xml
<Cluster>
  <Timestamp>123456</Timestamp>
  <BlockGroup>
    <!-- ReferenceBlock value not recovered from the codec -->
    <ReferenceBlock>0</ReferenceBlock>
    <BlockDuration>20<BlockDuration>
    <Block/>
  </BlockGroup>
  ...
</Cluster>
```

* BlockGroup with a frame that references two other frames, with the EBML tree shown as XML:

```xml
<Cluster>
  <Timestamp>123456</Timestamp>
  <BlockGroup>
    <!-- References a Block 80 Track Ticks before this one -->
    <ReferenceBlock>-80</ReferenceBlock>
    <!-- References a Block 40 Track Ticks after this one -->
    <ReferenceBlock>40</ReferenceBlock>
    <Block/>
  </BlockGroup>
  ...
</Cluster>
```

Intra-only video frames, such as the ones found in AV1 or VP9, can be decoded without any other
frame, but they don't reset the codec state. So seeking to these frames is not possible
as the next frames may need frames that are not known from this seeking point.
Such intra-only frames **MUST NOT** be considered as keyframes so the keyframe flag
**MUST NOT** be set in the `SimpleBlock` or a `ReferenceBlock` **MUST** be used
to signify the frame is not a RAP. The timestamp value of the `ReferenceBlock` **MUST**
be "0", meaning it's referencing itself.

* Intra-only frame not an RAP, with the EBML tree shown as XML:

```xml
<Cluster>
  <Timestamp>123456</Timestamp>
  <BlockGroup>
    <!-- References itself to mark it should not be used as RAP -->
    <ReferenceBlock>0</ReferenceBlock>
    <Block/>
  </BlockGroup>
  ...
</Cluster>
```

Because a video `SimpleBlock` has less references information than a video `BlockGroup`,
it is possible to remux a video track using `BlockGroup` into a `SimpleBlock`,
as long as it doesn't use any other `BlockGroup` features than `ReferenceBlock`.


# Timestamps

Historically timestamps in Matroska were mistakenly called timecodes. The `Timestamp Element`
was called Timecode, the `TimestampScale Element` was called TimecodeScale, the
`TrackTimestampScale Element` was called TrackTimecodeScale and the
`ReferenceTimestamp Element` was called ReferenceTimeCode.

## Timestamp Ticks

All timestamp values in Matroska are expressed in multiples of a tick.
They are usually stored as integers.
There are three types of ticks possible:

### Matroska Ticks

For such elements, the timestamp value is stored directly in nanoseconds.

The elements storing values in Matroska Ticks/nanoseconds are:

* `TrackEntry\DefaultDuration`; defined in (#defaultduration-element)
* `TrackEntry\DefaultDecodedFieldDuration`; defined in (#defaultdecodedfieldduration-element)
* `TrackEntry\SeekPreRoll`; defined in (#seekpreroll-element)
* `TrackEntry\CodecDelay`; defined in (#codecdelay-element)
* `BlockGroup\DiscardPadding`; defined in (#discardpadding-element)
* `ChapterAtom\ChapterTimeStart`; defined in (#chaptertimestart-element)
* `ChapterAtom\ChapterTimeEnd`; defined in (#chaptertimeend-element)
* `CuePoint\CueTime`; defined in (#cuetime-element)
* `CueReference\CueRefTime`; defined in (#cuetime-element)

### Segment Ticks

Elements in Segment Ticks involve the use of the `TimestampScale Element` of the Segment to get the timestamp
in nanoseconds of the element, with the following formula:

    timestamp in nanosecond = element value * TimestampScale

This allows storing smaller integer values in the elements.

When using the default value of `TimestampScale` of "1,000,000", one Segment Tick represents one millisecond.

The elements storing values in Segment Ticks are:

* `Cluster\Timestamp`; defined in (#timestamp-element)
* `Info\Duration` is stored as a floating-point but the same formula applies; defined in (#duration-element)
* `CuePoint\CueTrackPositions\CueDuration`; defined in (#cueduration-element)

### Track Ticks

Elements in Track Ticks involve the use of the `TimestampScale Element` of the Segment and the `TrackTimestampScale Element` of the Track
to get the timestamp in nanoseconds of the element, with the following formula:

    timestamp in nanoseconds =
        element value * TrackTimestampScale * TimestampScale

This allows storing smaller integer values in the elements.
The resulting floating-point values of the timestamps are still expressed in nanoseconds.

When using the default values for `TimestampScale` and `TrackTimestampScale` of "1,000,000" and of "1.0" respectively, one Track Tick represents one millisecond.

The elements storing values in Track Ticks are:

* `Cluster\BlockGroup\Block` and `Cluster\SimpleBlock` timestamps; detailed in (#block-timestamps)
* `Cluster\BlockGroup\BlockDuration`; defined in (#blockduration-element)
* `Cluster\BlockGroup\ReferenceBlock`; defined in (#referenceblock-element)

When the `TrackTimestampScale` is interpreted as "1.0", Track Ticks are equivalent to Segment Ticks
and give an integer value in nanoseconds. This is the most common case as `TrackTimestampScale` is usually omitted.

A value of `TrackTimestampScale` other than "1.0" **MAY** be used
to scale the timestamps more in tune with each Track sampling frequency.
For historical reasons, a lot of Matroska readers don't take the `TrackTimestampScale` value in account.
So using a value other than "1.0" might not work in many places.

## Block Timestamps

A `Block Element` and `SimpleBlock Element` timestamp is the time when the decoded data of the first
frame in the Block/SimpleBlock **MUST** be presented, if the track of that Block/SimpleBlock is selected for playback.
This is also known as the Presentation Timestamp (PTS).

The `Block Element` and `SimpleBlock Element` store their timestamps as signed integers, relative
to the `Cluster\Timestamp` value of the `Cluster` they are stored in.
To get the timestamp of a `Block` or `SimpleBlock` in nanoseconds you have to use the following formula:

    ( Cluster\Timestamp + ( block timestamp * TrackTimestampScale ) ) *
    TimestampScale

The `Block Element` and `SimpleBlock Element` store their timestamps as 16bit signed integers,
allowing a range from "-32768" to "+32767" Track Ticks.
Although these values can be negative, when added to the `Cluster\Timestamp`, the resulting frame timestamp **SHOULD NOT** be negative.

When a `CodecDelay Element` is set, its value **MUST** be substracted from each Block timestamp of that track.
To get the timestamp in nanoseconds of the first frame in a `Block` or `SimpleBlock`, the formula becomes:

    ( ( Cluster\Timestamp + ( block timestamp * TrackTimestampScale ) ) *
      TimestampScale ) - CodecDelay

The resulting frame timestamp **SHOULD NOT** be negative.

During playback, when a frame has a negative timestamp, the content **MUST** be decoded by the decoder but not played to the user.

## TimestampScale Rounding

The default Track Tick duration is one millisecond.

The `TimestampScale` is a floating-point value, which is usually 1.0. But when it's not, the multiplied
Block Timestamp is a floating-point value in nanoseconds.
The `Matroska Reader` **SHOULD** use the nearest rounding value in nanosecond to get
the proper nanosecond timestamp of a Block. This allows some clever `TimestampScale` values
to have more refined timestamp precision per frame.

# Language Codes

Matroska from version 1 through 3 uses language codes that can be either the 3 letters
bibliographic ISO-639-2 form [@!ISO639-2] (like "fre" for French),
or such a language code followed by a dash and a country code for specialities in languages (like "fre-ca" for Canadian French).
The `ISO 639-2 Language Elements` are "Language Element", "TagLanguage Element", and "ChapLanguage Element".

Starting in Matroska version 4, either [@!ISO639-2] or [@!BCP47] **MAY** be used,
although `BCP 47` is **RECOMMENDED**. The `BCP 47 Language Elements` are "LanguageBCP47 Element",
"TagLanguageBCP47 Element", and "ChapLanguageBCP47 Element". If a `BCP 47 Language Element` and an `ISO 639-2 Language Element`
are used within the same `Parent Element`, then the `ISO 639-2 Language Element` **MUST** be ignored and precedence given to the `BCP 47 Language Element`.

# Country Codes

Country codes are the [@!BCP47] two-letter region subtag, without the UK exception.


# Encryption

Encryption in Matroska is designed in a very generic style to allow people to
implement whatever form of encryption is best for them. It is possible to use the
encryption framework in Matroska as a type of DRM (Digital Rights Management).

This document does not specify any kind of standard for encrypting elements.
The issue of key scheduling, authorisation, and authentication are out of scope.
External entities have used these elements in proprietary ways.

Because encryption occurs within the `Block Element`, it is possible to manipulate
encrypted streams without decrypting them. The streams could potentially be copied,
deleted, cut, appended, or any number of other possible editing techniques without
decryption. The data can be used without having to expose it or go through the decrypting process.

Encryption can also be layered within Matroska. This means that two completely different
types of encryption can be used, requiring two separate keys to be able to decrypt a stream.

Encryption information is stored in the `ContentEncodings Element` under the `ContentEncryption Element`.

For encryption systems sharing public/private keys, the creation of the keys and the exchange of keys
are not covered by this document. They have to be handled by the system using Matroska.

The `ContentEncodingScope Element` gives an idea of which part of the track are encrypted.
But each `ContentEncAlgo Element` and its sub elements like `AESSettingsCipherMode` really
define how the encrypted should be exactly interpreted.

The AES-CTR system, which corresponds to `ContentEncAlgo` = 5 ((#contentencalgo-element)) and `AESSettingsCipherMode` = 1 ((#aessettingsciphermode-element)),
is defined in the [@?WebM-Enc] document.

# Image Presentation

## Cropping

The `PixelCrop Elements` (`PixelCropTop`, `PixelCropBottom`, `PixelCropRight`, and `PixelCropLeft`)
indicate when, and by how much, encoded videos frames **SHOULD** be cropped for display.
These Elements allow edges of the frame that are not intended for display, such as the
sprockets of a full-frame film scan or the VANC area of a digitized analog videotape,
to be stored but hidden. `PixelCropTop` and `PixelCropBottom` store an integer of how many
rows of pixels **SHOULD** be cropped from the top and bottom of the image (respectively).
 `PixelCropLeft` and `PixelCropRight` store an integer of how many columns of pixels
 **SHOULD** be cropped from the left and right of the image (respectively). 
 
 For example,
 a pillar-boxed video that stores a 1440x1080 visual image within the center of a padded
 1920x1080 encoded image may set both `PixelCropLeft` and `PixelCropRight` to "240",
 so that a `Matroska Player` should crop off 240 columns of pixels from the left and
 right of the encoded image to present the image with the pillar-boxes hidden.

Cropping has to be performed before resizing and the display dimensions given by
 `DisplayWidth`, `DisplayHeight` and `DisplayUnit` apply to the already cropped image.

## Rotation

The ProjectionPoseRoll Element (see (#projectionposeroll-element)) can be used to indicate
that the image from the associated video track **SHOULD** be rotated for presentation.
For instance, the following representation of the Projection Element (#projection-element))
and the ProjectionPoseRoll Element represents a video track where the image **SHOULD** be
presented with a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation, with the EBML tree shown as XML :

```xml
<Projection>
  <ProjectionPoseRoll>90</ProjectionPoseRoll>
</Projection>
```
Figure: Rotation example.

# Segment Position

The `Segment Position` of an `Element` refers to the position of the first octet of the
`Element ID` of that `Element`, measured in octets, from the beginning of the `Element Data`
section of the containing `Segment Element`. In other words, the `Segment Position` of an
`Element` is the distance in octets from the beginning of its containing `Segment Element`
minus the size of the `Element ID` and `Element Data Size` of that `Segment Element`.
The `Segment Position` of the first `Child Element` of the `Segment Element` is 0.
An `Element` which is not stored within a `Segment Element`, such as the `Elements` of
the `EBML Header`, do not have a `Segment Position`.

## Segment Position Exception

`Elements` that are defined to store a `Segment Position` **MAY** define reserved values to
indicate a special meaning.

## Example of Segment Position

This table presents an example of `Segment Position` by showing a hexadecimal representation
of a very small Matroska file with labels to show the offsets in octets. The file contains
a `Segment Element` with an `Element ID` of "0x18538067" and a `MuxingApp Element` with an `Element ID` of "0x4D80".

         0                             1                             2
         0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0
         +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
       0 |1A|45|DF|A3|8B|42|82|88|6D|61|74|72|6F|73|6B|61|
         ^ EBML Header
       0 |                                               |18|53|80|67|
                                                         ^ Segment ID
      20 |93|
         ^ Segment Data Size
      20 |  |15|49|A9|66|8E|4D|80|84|69|65|74|66|57|41|84|69|65|74|66|
            ^ Start of Segment data
      20 |                 |4D|80|84|69|65|74|66|57|41|84|69|65|74|66|
                           ^ MuxingApp start

In the above example, the `Element ID` of the `Segment Element` is stored at offset 16,
the `Element Data Size` of the `Segment Element` is stored at offset 20, and the
`Element Data` of the `Segment Element` is stored at offset 21.

The `MuxingApp Element` is stored at offset 26. Since the `Segment Position` of
an `Element` is calculated by subtracting the position of the `Element Data` of
the containing `Segment Element` from the position of that `Element`, the `Segment Position`
of `MuxingApp Element` in the above example is '26 - 21' or '5'.



# Linked Segments

Matroska provides several methods to link two or more `Segment Elements` together to create
a `Linked Segment`. A `Linked Segment` is a set of multiple `Segments` linked together into
a single presentation by using Hard Linking or Medium Linking.

All `Segments` within a `Linked Segment` **MUST** have a `SegmentUUID`.

All `Segments` within a `Linked Segment` **SHOULD** be stored within the same directory
or be accessible quickly based on their `SegmentUUID`
in order to have seamless transition between segments.

All `Segments` within a `Linked Segment` **MAY** set a `SegmentFamily` with a common value to make
it easier for a `Matroska Player` to know which `Segments` are meant to be played together.

The `SegmentFilename`, `PrevFilename` and `NextFilename` elements **MAY** also give hints on
the original filenames that were used when the Segment links were created, in case some `SegmentUUID` are damaged.

## Hard Linking

Hard Linking, also called splitting, is the process of creating a `Linked Segment`
by linking multiple `Segment Elements` using the `NextUUID` and `PrevUUID` Elements.

All `Segments` within a `Hard Linked Segment` **MUST** use the same `Tracks` list and `TimestampScale`.

Within a `Linked Segment`, the timestamps of `Block` and `SimpleBlock` **MUST** follow consecutively
the timestamps of `Block` and `SimpleBlock` from the previous `Segment` in linking order.

With Hard Linking, the chapters of any `Segment` within the `Linked Segment` **MUST** only reference the current `Segment`.
The `NextUUID` and `PrevUUID` reference the respective `SegmentUUID` values of the next and previous `Segments`.

The first `Segment` of a `Linked Segment` **MUST NOT** have a `PrevUUID Element`.
The last `Segment` of a `Linked Segment` **MUST NOT** have a `NextUUID Element`.

For each node of the chain of `Segments` of a `Linked Segment` at least one `Segment` **MUST** reference the other `Segment` within the chain.

In a chain of `Segments` of a `Linked Segment` the `NextUUID` always takes precedence over the `PrevUUID`.
So if SegmentA has a `NextUUID` to SegmentB and SegmentB has a `PrevUUID` to SegmentC,
the link to use is `NextUUID` between SegmentA and SegmentB, SegmentC is not part of the Linked Segment.

If SegmentB has a `PrevUUID` to SegmentA but SegmentA has no `NextUUID`, then the Matroska Player
**MAY** consider these two Segments linked as SegmentA followed by SegmentB.

As an example, three `Segments` can be Hard Linked as a `Linked Segment` through
cross-referencing each other with `SegmentUUID`, `PrevUUID`, and `NextUUID`, as in this table:

file name   | `SegmentUUID`                     | `PrevUUID`                        | `NextUUID`
:-----------|:----------------------------------|:----------------------------------|:---------
`start.mkv` | 71000c23cd310998 53fbc94dd984a5dd | Invalid                           | a77b3598941cb803 eac0fcdafe44fac9
`middle.mkv`| a77b3598941cb803 eac0fcdafe44fac9 | 71000c23cd310998 53fbc94dd984a5dd | 6c92285fa6d3e827 b198d120ea3ac674
`end.mkv`   | 6c92285fa6d3e827 b198d120ea3ac674 | a77b3598941cb803 eac0fcdafe44fac9 | Invalid
Table: Usual Hard Linking UIDs{#hardLinkingUIDs}

An other example where only the `NextUUID` Element is used:

file name   | `SegmentUUID`                     | `PrevUUID`                        | `NextUUID`
:-----------|:----------------------------------|:----------------------------------|:---------
`start.mkv` | 71000c23cd310998 53fbc94dd984a5dd | Invalid                           | a77b3598941cb803 eac0fcdafe44fac9
`middle.mkv`| a77b3598941cb803 eac0fcdafe44fac9 | n/a                               | 6c92285fa6d3e827 b198d120ea3ac674
`end.mkv`   | 6c92285fa6d3e827 b198d120ea3ac674 | n/a                               | Invalid
Table: Hard Linking without PrevUUID{#hardLinkingWoPrevUUID}

An example where only the `PrevUUID` Element is used:

file name   | `SegmentUUID`                     | `PrevUUID`                        | `NextUUID`
:-----------|:----------------------------------|:----------------------------------|:---------
`start.mkv` | 71000c23cd310998 53fbc94dd984a5dd | Invalid                           | n/a
`middle.mkv`| a77b3598941cb803 eac0fcdafe44fac9 | 71000c23cd310998 53fbc94dd984a5dd | n/a
`end.mkv`   | 6c92285fa6d3e827 b198d120ea3ac674 | a77b3598941cb803 eac0fcdafe44fac9 | Invalid
Table: Hard Linking without NextUUID{#hardLinkingWoNextUUID}

In this example only the `middle.mkv` is using the `PrevUUID` and `NextUUID` Elements:

file name   | `SegmentUUID`                     | `PrevUUID`                        | `NextUUID`
:-----------|:----------------------------------|:----------------------------------|:---------
`start.mkv` | 71000c23cd310998 53fbc94dd984a5dd | Invalid                           | n/a
`middle.mkv`| a77b3598941cb803 eac0fcdafe44fac9 | 71000c23cd310998 53fbc94dd984a5dd | 6c92285fa6d3e827 b198d120ea3ac674
`end.mkv`   | 6c92285fa6d3e827 b198d120ea3ac674 | n/a                               | Invalid
Table: Hard Linking with mixed UID links{#hardLinkingMixedUIDs}

## Medium Linking

Medium Linking creates relationships between `Segments` using Ordered Chapters ((#editionflagordered)) and the
`ChapterSegmentUUID Element`. A `Chapter Edition` with Ordered Chapters **MAY** contain
Chapter elements that reference timestamp ranges from other `Segments`. The `Segment`
referenced by the Ordered Chapter via the `ChapterSegmentUUID Element` **SHOULD** be played as
part of a Linked Segment.

The timestamps of Segment content referenced by Ordered Chapters
**MUST** be adjusted according to the cumulative duration of the previous Ordered Chapters.

As an example a file named `intro.mkv` could have a `SegmentUUID` of "0xb16a58609fc7e60653a60c984fc11ead".
Another file called `program.mkv` could use a Chapter Edition that contains two Ordered Chapters.
The first chapter references the `Segment` of `intro.mkv` with the use of a `ChapterSegmentUUID`,
`ChapterSegmentEditionUID`, `ChapterTimeStart`, and optionally a `ChapterTimeEnd` element.
The second chapter references content within the `Segment` of `program.mkv`. A `Matroska Player`
**SHOULD** recognize the `Linked Segment` created by the use of `ChapterSegmentUUID` in an enabled
`Edition` and present the reference content of the two `Segments` as a single presentation.

The `ChapterSegmentUUID` represents the Segment that holds the content to play in place of the `Linked Chapter`.
The `ChapterSegmentUUID` **MUST NOT** be the `SegmentUUID` of its own `Segment`.

There are 2 ways to use a chapter link:

* Linked-Duration linking,

* Linked-Edition linking

### Linked-Duration

A `Matroska Player` **MUST** play the content of the linked Segment
from the `ChapterTimeStart` until `ChapterTimeEnd` timestamp in place of the `Linked Chapter`.

`ChapterTimeStart` and `ChapterTimeEnd` represent timestamps in the Linked Segment matching the value of `ChapterSegmentUUID`.
Their values **MUST** be in the range of the linked Segment duration.

The `ChapterTimeEnd` value **MUST** be set when using linked-duration chapter linking.
`ChapterSegmentEditionUID` **MUST NOT** be set.

### Linked-Edition

A `Matroska Player` **MUST** play the whole linked `Edition` of the linked Segment in place of the `Linked Chapter`.

`ChapterSegmentEditionUID` represents a valid Edition from the Linked Segment matching the value of `ChapterSegmentUUID`.

When using linked-edition chapter linking. `ChapterTimeEnd` is **OPTIONAL**.



# Track Flags

## Default flag

The "default track" flag is a hint for a `Matroska Player` indicating that a given track
**SHOULD** be eligible to be automatically selected as the default track for a given
language. If no tracks in a given language have the default track flag set, then all tracks
in that language are eligible for automatic selection. This can be used to indicate that
a track provides "regular service" suitable for users with default settings, as opposed to
specialized services, such as commentary, hearing-impaired captions, or descriptive audio.

The `Matroska Player` **MAY** override the "default track" flag for any reason, including
user preferences to prefer tracks providing accessibility services.

## Forced flag

The "forced" flag tells the `Matroska Player` that it **SHOULD** display this subtitle track,
even if user preferences usually would not call for any subtitles to be displayed alongside
the current selected audio track. This can be used to indicate that a track contains translations
of onscreen text, or of dialogue spoken in a different language than the track's primary one.

## Hearing-impaired flag

The "hearing impaired" flag tells the `Matroska Player` that it **SHOULD** prefer this track
when selecting a default track for a hearing-impaired user, and that it **MAY** prefer to select
a different track when selecting a default track for a non-hearing-impaired user.

## Visual-impaired flag

The "visual impaired" flag tells the `Matroska Player` that it **SHOULD** prefer this track
when selecting a default track for a visually-impaired user, and that it **MAY** prefer to select
a different track when selecting a default track for a non-visually-impaired user.

## Descriptions flag

The "descriptions" flag tells the `Matroska Player` that this track is suitable to play via
a text-to-speech system for a visually-impaired user, and that it **SHOULD NOT** automatically
select this track when selecting a default track for a non-visually-impaired user.

## Original flag

The "original" flag tells the `Matroska Player` that this track is in the original language,
and that it **SHOULD** prefer it if configured to prefer original-language tracks of this
track's type.

## Commentary flag

The "commentary" flag tells the `Matroska Player` that this track contains commentary on
the content.

## Track Operation

`TrackOperation` allows combining multiple tracks to make a virtual one. It uses
two separate system to combine tracks. One to create a 3D "composition" (left/right/background planes)
and one to simplify join two tracks together to make a single track.

A track created with `TrackOperation` is a proper track with a UID and all its flags.
However, the codec ID is meaningless because each "sub" track needs to be decoded by its
own decoder before the "operation" is applied. The `Cues Elements` corresponding to such
a virtual track **SHOULD** be the union of the `Cues Elements` for each of the tracks it's composed of (when the `Cues` are defined per track).

In the case of `TrackJoinBlocks`, the `Block Elements` (from `BlockGroup` and `SimpleBlock`)
of all the tracks **SHOULD** be used as if they were defined for this new virtual `Track`.
When two `Block Elements` have overlapping start or end timestamps, it's up to the underlying
system to either drop some of these frames or render them the way they overlap.
This situation **SHOULD** be avoided when creating such tracks as you can never be sure
of the end result on different platforms.

## Overlay Track

Overlay tracks **SHOULD** be rendered in the same channel as the track it's linked to.
When content is found in such a track, it **SHOULD** be played on the rendering channel
instead of the original track.

## Multi-planar and 3D videos

There are two different ways to compress 3D videos: have each eye track in a separate track
and have one track have both eyes combined inside (which is more efficient, compression-wise).
Matroska supports both ways.

For the single track variant, there is the `StereoMode Element`, which defines how planes are
assembled in the track (mono or left-right combined). Odd values of StereoMode means the left
plane comes first for more convenient reading. The pixel count of the track (`PixelWidth`/`PixelHeight`)
is the raw amount of pixels, for example 3840x1080 for full HD side by side, and the `DisplayWidth`/`DisplayHeight`
in pixels is the amount of pixels for one plane (1920x1080 for that full HD stream).
Old stereo 3D were displayed using anaglyph (cyan and red colors separated).
For compatibility with such movies, there is a value of the StereoMode that corresponds to AnaGlyph.

There is also a "packed" mode (values 13 and 14) which consists of packing two frames together
in a `Block` using lacing. The first frame is the left eye and the other frame is the right eye
(or vice versa). The frames **SHOULD** be decoded in that order and are possibly dependent
on each other (P and B frames).

For separate tracks, Matroska needs to define exactly which track does what.
`TrackOperation` with `TrackCombinePlanes` do that. For more details look at
(#track-operation) on how TrackOperation works.

The 3D support is still in infancy and may evolve to support more features.

The StereoMode used to be part of Matroska v2 but it didn't meet the requirement
for multiple tracks. There was also a bug in libmatroska prior to 0.9.0 that would save/read
it as `0x53B9` instead of `0x53B8`; see OldStereoMode ((#oldstereomode-element)). `Matroska Readers` **MAY** support these legacy files by checking
Matroska v2 or `0x53B9`.
The older values of StereoMode were 0: mono, 1: right eye, 2: left eye, 3: both eyes, the only values that can be found in OldStereoMode.
They are not compatible with the StereoMode values found in Matroska v3 and above.


# Default track selection

This section provides some example sets of Tracks and hypothetical user settings, along with
indications of which ones a similarly-configured `Matroska Player` **SHOULD** automatically
select for playback by default in such a situation. A player **MAY** provide additional settings
with more detailed controls for more nuanced scenarios. These examples are provided as guidelines
to illustrate the intended usages of the various supported Track flags, and their expected behaviors.

Track names are shown in English for illustrative purposes; actual files may have titles
in the language of each track, or provide titles in multiple languages.

## Audio Selection

Example track set:

Table: Audio Tracks for default selection{#audioTrackSelection}

Here we have a file with 7 audio tracks, of which 5 are in English and 2 are in Spanish.

The English tracks all have the Original flag, indicating that English is the original content language.

Generally the player will first consider the track languages: if the player has an option to prefer
original-language audio and the user has enabled it, then it should prefer one of the Original-flagged tracks.
If configured to specifically prefer audio tracks in English or Spanish, the player should select one of
the tracks in the corresponding language. The player may also wish to prefer an Original-flagged track
if no tracks matching any of the user's explicitly-preferred languages are available.

Two of the tracks have the Visual-impaired flag. If the player has been configured to prefer such tracks,
it should select one; otherwise, it should avoid them if possible.

If selecting an English track, when other settings have left multiple possible options,
it may be useful to exclude the tracks that lack the Default flag: here, one provides descriptive service for
the visually impaired (which has its own flag and may be automatically selected by user configuration,
but is unsuitable for users with default-configured players), one is a commentary track
(which has its own flag, which the player may or may not have specialized handling for),
and the last contains karaoke versions of the music that plays during the film, which is an unusual
specialized audio service that Matroska has no built-in support for indicating, so it's indicated
in the track name instead. By not setting the Default flag on these specialized tracks, the file's author
hints that they should not be automatically selected by a default-configured player.

Having narrowed its choices down, our example player now may have to select between tracks 2 and 3.
The only difference between these tracks is their channel layouts: 2 is 5.1 surround, while 3 is stereo.
If the player is aware that the output device is a pair of headphones or stereo speakers, it may wish
to prefer the stereo mix automatically. On the other hand, if it knows that the device is a surround system,
it may wish to prefer the surround mix.

If the player finishes analyzing all of the available audio tracks and finds that multiple seem equally
and maximally preferable, it **SHOULD** default to the first of the group.

Table: Subtitle Tracks for default selection{#subtitleTrackSelection}

Here we have 2 audio tracks and 5 subtitle tracks. As we can see, French is the original language.

We'll start by discussing the case where the user prefers French (or Original-language)
audio (or has explicitly selected the French audio track), and also prefers French subtitles.

In this case, if the player isn't configured to display captions when the audio matches their
preferred subtitle languages, the player doesn't need to select a subtitle track at all.

If the user _has_ indicated that they want captions to be displayed, the selection simply
comes down to whether Hearing-impaired subtitles are preferred.

The situation for a user who prefers Portuguese subtitles starts out somewhat analogous.
If they select the original French audio (either by explicit audio language preference,
preference for Original-language tracks, or by explicitly selecting that track), then the
selection once again comes down to the hearing-impaired preference.

However, the case where the Portuguese audio track is selected has an important catch:
a Forced track in Portuguese is present. This may contain translations of onscreen text
from the video track, or of portions of the audio that are not translated (music, for instance).
This means that even if the user's preferences wouldn't normally call for captions here,
the Forced track should be selected nonetheless, rather than selecting no track at all.
On the other hand, if the user's preferences _do_ call for captions, the non-Forced tracks
should be preferred, as the Forced track will not contain captioning for the dialogue.

# Cues

The `Cues Element` provides an index of certain `Cluster Elements` to allow for optimized
seeking to absolute timestamps within the `Segment`. The `Cues Element` contains one or
many `CuePoint Elements` which each **MUST** reference an absolute timestamp (via the
`CueTime Element`), a `Track` (via the `CueTrack Element`), and a `Segment Position`
(via the `CueClusterPosition Element`). Additional non-mandated Elements are part of
the `CuePoint Element` such as `CueDuration`, `CueRelativePosition`, `CueCodecState`
and others which provide any `Matroska Reader` with additional information to use in
the optimization of seeking performance.

## Recommendations

The following recommendations are provided to optimize Matroska performance.

- Unless Matroska is used as a live stream, it **SHOULD** contain a `Cues Element`.
- For each video track, each keyframe **SHOULD** be referenced by a `CuePoint Element`.
- It is **RECOMMENDED** to not reference non-keyframes of video tracks in `Cues` unless
  it references a `Cluster Element` which contains a `CodecState Element` but no keyframes.
- For each subtitle track present, each subtitle frame **SHOULD** be referenced by a
  `CuePoint Element` with a `CueDuration Element`.
- References to audio tracks **MAY** be skipped in `CuePoint Elements` if a video track
  is present. When included the `CuePoint Elements` **SHOULD** reference audio keyframes
  at most once every 500 milliseconds.
- If the referenced frame is not stored within the first `SimpleBlock`, or first
  `BlockGroup` within its `Cluster Element`, then the `CueRelativePosition Element`
   **SHOULD** be written to reference where in the `Cluster` the reference frame is stored.
- If a `CuePoint Element` references `Cluster Element` that includes a `CodecState Element`,
  then that `CuePoint Element` **MUST** use a `CueCodecState Element`.
- `CuePoint Elements` **SHOULD** be numerically sorted in storage order by the value of the `CueTime Element`.

# Security Considerations

Matroska inherits security considerations from EBML.

Attacks on a `Matroska Reader` could include:

* Storage of a arbitrary and potentially executable data within an `Attachment Element`.
  `Matroska Readers` that extract or use data from Matroska Attachments **SHOULD**
  check that the data adheres to expectations.

* A `Matroska Attachment` with an inaccurate mime-type.

* Damage to the Encryption and Compression fields ((#encryption)) that would result in bogus binary data
  interpreted by the decoder.

* Chapter Codecs running unwanted commands on the host system.
